    "# Managing a To-Do List with Python Lists\n",
    "The first example demonstrates managing a to-do list. We will create a list to keep track of all the tasks planned for the day. For instance, after opening an app, you might select tasks such as buying groceries, cleaning the house, and paying bills. As new tasks arise, they can be added to the list. Once a task is completed, it can be removed from the list. The following code illustrates these operations."
